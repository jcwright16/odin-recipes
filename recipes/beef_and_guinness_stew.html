		<figcaption>This hearty Guinness beef stew recipe is perfect for cozy days at home.</figcaption>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>In 1746, the first Polish language dictionary defined a horse through the phrase, "Kon&#769, jaki jest, kaz&#856dy widzi", which roughly translates to "What a horse is, everyone can see." Well, dear reader, what a good stew is, anyone can see as well, and such a thing is to be found here. Experience the joy of this Irish classic.</p>

			<li>Turn heat down to medium; cook and stir onions in the retained fat in the skillet until lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes; season with a large pinch of salt.</li>
			<li>Cook garlic with onions until soft, about 1 minute. Pour beer into the skillet and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up and dissovling any browned bits of food into the liquid.</li>
			<li>Pour cooking liquid from the skillet into the stew pot. Stir in tomato paste, carrots, celery, thyme sprigs, sugar, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon black pepper, and enough chicken broth to cover.</li>
			<li>Bring stew to a gentle simmer, stirring to combine; reduce heat to low and cover popt.</li>
			<li>Simmer stew until beef is fork-tender, about 2 hours.</li>
			<li>Stir stew occasionally and skim fat or foam if desired.</li>
			<li>Remove cover and raise heat to medium-high. Bring stew to a low boil and cook until stew has slightly thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove and discard thyme sprigs and adjust salt and pepper to taste.</li>
